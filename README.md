## Exercises

Complete the following exercises to improve your HTML and CSS skills. Each exercise builds upon the existing code. (done exercises will be marked in ✅ and those not done yet in ❌)

- Center the entire keyboard on the viewport. You can use `vw` and `vh` units of measure for setting the viewport size and `flex` to position the entire keyboard. ✅

- Add a border radius for keyboard, keypad and keys as appropriate, to create a more realistic look of the corners. ✅

- The current keyboard has a fixed-width keypad that doesn't fill the container on larger screens. Modify the CSS so that the keypad always fills 100% of the available width in the keyboard container, regardless of screen resolution.
✅
- Add visual feedback when hovering over keys. White keys should turn light gray (#f0f0f0) and black keys should turn dark gray (#333) when hovered.❌

- Add smooth CSS transitions to all hover and active states created in exercise 2. The transitions should take 0.1 seconds.❌

- Add note labels (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) to the white keys, then repeat. Position them at the bottom of each white key. Style them with a small font size (10px) and centered alignment. Do the same exercise for black keys, by adding the appropriate labels (C#, Eb, F#, G#, Bb). In the end, for one octave (first 12 keys), the order of the labels should be:
`C C# D Eb E F F# G G# A Bb B`. Then, repeat for the rest of the keys. ❌

- Add realistic shadows to create depth: ❌
    - White keys should have an inset shadow
    - Black keys should have a subtle drop shadow
    - When hovered, the shadows should change to create a pressed-in effect
